# StudentLoanRiskAssessor

## Project Overview

In order to identify and distinguish between students who are good loan risks and those who are bad loan risks, a predictive model must be developed. This model will determine the characteristics of both types of students, based on their given individual situations and histories at the time that they applied for the loan. The target variable 'NoPaymentDue' records whether the given student was behind on their payments after one calendar year that they were supposed to start paying down their loan.

## Business Objectives

* **Identify Risk Factors:** Develop a predictive model to accurately identify and distinguish between students who are likely to be good loan risks and those who are likely to be bad loan risks.
* **Minimize Financial Risks:** Reduce default rates and minimize financial losses by accurately predicting which students might be poor loan risks.
* **Maximize Financial Gains:** Enhance profitability by loaning to students who are predicted to be good loan risks.
* **Enhance Decision Making:** Improve the overall decision-making process in the student loan approval procedures, making it more data-driven and efficient.

## Model Description

The predictive model will use historical data on student loans, including payment histories, socioeconomic backgrounds, educational institutions, course of study, and employment prospects post-graduation. Techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, or advanced machine learning algorithms might be employed to analyze these characteristics and predict the likelihood of a student defaulting on their loan.

## Expected Outcomes

The successful implementation of this model is expected to help in:

- Reducing the number of loans given to students with a high likelihood of default.
- Increasing the confidence in loan approvals for students with good risk profiles.
- Improving the financial stability of the loan issuing institution by avoiding bad debts.
